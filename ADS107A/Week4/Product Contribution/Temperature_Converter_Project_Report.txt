Project Report: Temperature Converter

Introduction:
This report documents the enhancements made to a Temperature Converter web application, emphasizing software development principles, interface design, and accessibility.

Development Setup:
Developed using Visual Studio Code, the project was forked from GitHub. The initial code structure was present but lacked functional implementation of the core feature.

Functionality Implemented:
Implemented the key feature of converting temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Enhanced accessibility by adding 'aria-label' attributes to the input fields.

Testing Process:
Conducted manual testing for functionality and accuracy. Showcased the application to peers in the cohort, receiving positive feedback and validation of the tool's effectiveness.

Project Overview:
The Temperature Converter, initially a non-functional prototype, is now a fully operational tool, useful in educational settings and daily life.

Impact of Your Changes:
The contributions transformed the application into a working model, improving its usability and accessibility, especially for users with disabilities.

Use-Cases and Requirements:
- User Story 1: John, a science student, needs a quick and accurate way to convert temperatures for lab reports.
- User Story 2: Emily, visually impaired, requires a screen-reader-friendly application for her temperature conversion needs.

Conclusion:
This project provided practical experience in web development, particularly in JavaScript, and underscored the importance of accessibility in software design.
