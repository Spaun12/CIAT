---------------------------------------------------------------
Project: Python Dice Roller (Tkinter-based application)
Contributor: [Your Name]
Tools Used: GitHub, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), GitHub Desktop, Discord

1. **Overview of Changes**:
   - Enhanced the original six-sided dice roller to include functionality for rolling different types of dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 sides).
   - Implemented a dropdown menu for dice type selection in the Tkinter GUI.

2. **Development Process using VSCode, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop**:
   - Forked the original repository and cloned it using GitHub Desktop.
   - Created a new branch named 'dice-type-feature' for the updates.
   - Integrated new functionality for selecting different dice types, ensuring compatibility with the existing Tkinter setup.

3. **Testing, Committing, and Pushing Changes**:
   - Conducted thorough testing for each dice type within VSCode.
   - Staged and committed the changes with descriptive messages using GitHub Desktop.
   - Pushed the changes to the 'dice-type-feature' branch on GitHub.

4. **Collaboration, Feedback, and Creating a Pull Request**:
   - Collaborated with classmates via Discord, sharing progress and receiving feedback.
   - Utilized the feedback to refine the code and UI.
   - Created a pull request on GitHub to merge the 'dice-type-feature' branch into the main branch of the original repository.

5. **Reflection and Learning**:
   - Gained practical experience in using Git for version control, GitHub Desktop for managing repositories, and VSCode for Python development.
   - Learned the importance of collaboration and peer review, utilizing Discord as a platform for sharing ideas and receiving constructive feedback.
   - Enhanced understanding of GUI development with Tkinter and the process of contributing to open-source projects.

6. **Future Enhancements and Final Steps**:
   - Plan to explore adding a history feature to track past dice rolls.
   - Awaiting review of the pull request by the original repository maintainers.
   - Intent to sync the fork with the original repository post-merge to keep it up-to-date.
