Narrative for Section C

1. Creating a New User Group (newUserGroup)
   The first step was to create a new user group named 'newUserGroup'. This was successfully done using the command 'groupadd newUserGroup'.

2. Adding User to the New Group (newUserGroup)
   Next, I used the 'usermod -a -G newUserGroup new_username' command to add the existing user ('new_username') to this new group.

3. Changing the Primary Group of User to 'newUserGroup'
   To make 'newUserGroup' the primary group for 'new_username', the command 'usermod -g newUserGroup new_username' was executed. After this, a quick check using the 'groups new_username' command confirmed that 'newUserGroup' was indeed the primary group for the user.

4. Creating a Temporary User Group (tempUA)
   Due to a roadblock in deleting 'newUserGroup' (it was the primary group for 'new_username'), a temporary group named 'tempUA' was created using 'groupadd tempUA'.

5. Changing the Primary Group to 'tempUA'
   The primary group for 'new_username' was then switched to 'tempUA' using the command 'usermod -g tempUA new_username'.

6. Deleting the Original User Group (newUserGroup)
   With 'new_username' now belonging to a different primary group ('tempUA'), the original 'newUserGroup' could be safely deleted using 'groupdel newUserGroup'.

7. Final Check
   A final 'groups new_username' command confirmed that 'new_username' was now part of the 'tempUA' group, and 'newUserGroup' was successfully removed.

Section D: Setting Permissions and Ownership

1. Created a directory called Week3_UserGroupManagement.
   - Command: mkdir Week3_UserGroupManagement

2. Attempted to change the owner and group to new_username and newuser_name, but the group was invalid.
   - Command: chown new_username:newuser_name Week3_UserGroupManagment
   - Issue: chown: invalid group: ‘new_username:newuser_name’

3. Changed the owner to 'new_username' and group to 'tempUA'.
   - Command: chown new_username:tempUA Week3_UserGroupManagement

4. Changed the permissions to 700 (only owner can read, write, and execute).
   - Command: chmod 700 Week3_UserGroupManagement

5. Verified permissions and ownership with 'ls -l'.
   - Command: ls -l
   - Output showed owner as 'new_username' and group as 'tempUA' with permissions set to 700.

6. Tried to change the group to 'tempUA' again but mistyped the command.
   - Command: ~chgrp tempUA Week3_UserGroupManagement
   - Issue: Command not found.

7. Changed the group back to 'tempUA' successfully.
   - Command: chgrp tempUA Week3_UserGroupManagement

8. Modified permissions to 740 (owner can read, write, execute; group can read).
   - Command: chmod 740 Week3_UserGroupManagement

9. Created a new group named 'Week3_Group' to make it assignment-specific.
   - Command: groupadd Week3_Group

10. Changed the directory's group to 'Week3_Group'.
    - Command: chgrp Week3_Group Week3_UserGroupManagement
