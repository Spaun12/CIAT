# Week 2 Assignment Q2 Michael Connell

# Client enters value for a
a = int(input("Enter a value for a: "))
# b and c have been pre defined if a < 10
b = 0
c = 1
# By using "if function" followed by "else function" we
# eliminate anything below a 100 Value for x then 
if a < 10:
    print("b =" + str(b) + " " + "c =" + str(c))
# as long as the input of a < 10 the the value of b and b will display
# and catastrophy has been averted.
else:
    if a > 10:
        b += 1000000000
        c += 2000000000
        print("Error, the mixture will be wrong!" + "This could melt your eylashs with b=" + str(b) + "!" + " " + "Possible your eyebrows with c=" + str(c) + "!")
