# Client enters value for x
x = int(input("Enter a value for x: "))
# y and z have been pree defined
y = 20
z = 40
# By using "if function" followed by "else function" we
# eliminate anything below a 100 Value for x then 
if x < 100:
    print("Error Johnny5! Use value above 100!")
# as long as the input of x>100 the the value of x and y will display
else:
    print("Y =" + str(y) + " " + "Z =" + str(z))
