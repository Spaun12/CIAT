While Figma is fantastic for design, its export focus differs slightly from tools like Wix or Webflow:

- Design Focus: Figma's primary strength lies in creating UI/UX designs, mockups, and prototypes. It's a tool for visualizing how a website or app should look and function.

Exporting Designs, Not Fully Functional Sites:  Figma exports assets exquisitely:

- Images: You can export individual elements or entire screens in formats like PNG, JPG, SVG.
- Design Specs: Figma's handoff tools allow developers to see CSS properties, measurements, and other crucial design details.
- Limited Prototypes: While you can create clickable prototypes in Figma, they are simulations of the user experience, not fully deployable web environments.
- The Handoff:   Figma is a crucial first step but  generally requires development knowledge to turn designs into live websites:

Developers take your Figma design files and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the actual functionality of the website or app.
Some plugins help bridge this gap, but may have limitations compared to Webflow's direct code generation.
