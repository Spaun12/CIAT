1) Windows determines the program to open a file with either through file extension associations or user preferences.
2) Using `rename` is more efficient than copying and deleting because it simply updates the file's name without moving data.
3) Contiguous allocation leads to internal fragmentation, where space within allocated blocks is wasted because it is not fully used.
4) Interrupts are hardware signals requiring immediate attention, exceptions/faults are program errors needing correction, and traps are software-initiated interrupts for system functions.
5) The OS uses device drivers to communicate with new hardware, allowing easy installation without recompiling the OS.
