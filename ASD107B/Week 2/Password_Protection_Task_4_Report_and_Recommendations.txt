Task 4: Report and Recommendations

A. Findings from the Validation Process

1. Automated Testing Results:
   - Brute Force Attack: Noted system's response mechanisms to repeated failed login attempts.
   - Dictionary Attack: Assessed vulnerability to common passwords and robustness of password policies.
   - Rainbow Table Attack: Evaluated hashing and salting strategies for password storage.

2. Manual Testing Observations:
   - Phishing and Social Engineering: Identified user susceptibility to mock phishing and social scenarios.
   - User Behavior Analysis: Revealed risks in password creation and management habits.

3. Security Audit Findings:
   - Code Review: Highlighted areas for improvement in cryptographic practices and password storage.
   - Compliance: Assessed alignment with industry standards (OWASP, NIST).

B. Insights Gained
- Technical Vulnerabilities: Identification of specific weaknesses against common attack vectors.
- User-Centric Risks: Insights into user behavior-related risks.
- System Resilience: Assessment of overall defense against technical and non-technical threats.

C. Recommendations

1. Enhance Technical Safeguards:
   - Stronger password complexity requirements and use of password managers.
   - Improved hashing algorithms and incorporation of salting.
   - Account lockout policies and progressive delay mechanisms.

2. User Education and Awareness:
   - Regular cybersecurity training.
   - Guidelines on recognizing and responding to phishing.
   - Promotion of security mindfulness.

3. Regular Audits and Continuous Monitoring:
   - Routine security audits and code reviews.
   - Continuous monitoring for unusual login activities.
   - Updates in line with security trends and standards.

4. Adherence to Security Standards:
   - Ongoing compliance with frameworks like OWASP and NIST.
   - Regular updates to security policies.
