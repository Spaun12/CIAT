Task 3: Validation Approach and Tools

Testing Methodologies:

1. Automated Script Testing: Utilizing Python scripts to simulate attack vectors such as brute force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks, assessing the resilience of the password protection system.

2. Manual Testing for Social Engineering and Phishing: Conducting manual tests with mock phishing scenarios and social engineering tactics to evaluate user and system responses.

3. Security Audit and Code Review: Performing a detailed audit of the systemâ€™s codebase and configuration, focusing on password storage, encryption, and authentication processes.

4. User Behavior Analysis: Observing user behavior to identify vulnerabilities like password reuse or predictable patterns.

Tools and Libraries:

1. Python Libraries:
   - requests: For HTTP requests in login simulations.
   - itertools and string: For generating password combinations in brute force tests.
   - hashlib: For creating and comparing password hashes.

2. Penetration Testing Tools:
   - OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): For automated scanning of web applications.
   - Wireshark: To analyze network traffic for security breaches.

3. Password Strength Testers:
   - Tools like zxcvbn or online services for assessing password strength.

4. Security Frameworks and Standards:
   - Adherence to OWASP and NIST guidelines for password security best practices.

This comprehensive approach combines technical and human-factor analyses to ensure robust password protection.
