Hypothetical Assignment: Validating Password Protection System

### Task 1: Identifying Potential Threats (Hypothetical)

1. Brute Force Attacks: Theoretical risk of attackers trying every possible password combination.
2. Dictionary Attacks: Hypothetical use of a list of common passwords.
3. Phishing: Potential risk of users being tricked into revealing their passwords.
4. Keylogging: Theoretical threat of malware recording keystrokes.
5. Rainbow Table Attacks: Risk of using precomputed tables for hashed passwords.
6. Social Engineering: The potential of individuals being manipulated to disclose passwords.

### Task 2: Developing Theoretical Test Cases

# Outline of Hypothetical Python Scripts for Testing
# Note: These scripts are theoretical and not for actual testing due to lack of access.

# Brute Force Test (Hypothetical)
# A function to simulate how a brute force attack test might be conducted.
def hypothetical_brute_force_test():
    # ... (explanation of the hypothetical approach)

# Dictionary Attack Test (Hypothetical)
# A function to demonstrate a possible approach for a dictionary attack test.
def hypothetical_dictionary_attack_test():
    # ... (explanation of the hypothetical approach)

### Task 3: Validation Approach and Tools (Hypothetical)

- Discussion on how automated scripts in Python could be used for testing.
- Theoretical use of manual testing techniques for phishing and social engineering.
- Hypothetical application of tools like Wireshark and OWASP ZAP.
- Consideration of password strength testers for password complexity.

### Task 4: Hypothetical Findings and Recommendations

- Discussion on potential test results based on the hypothetical scenarios.
- Theoretical insights that might be gained.
- Recommendations based on the hypothetical findings and test scenarios.
