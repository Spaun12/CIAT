   Explanation: Feasibility assessment ensures the project's practicality and alignment with objectives.

16. Use of UCP (Use Case Points) in Software Estimation:
   Answer: Estimating the projected “size” of a software project based on use cases.
   Explanation: UCP helps estimate project size by evaluating the complexity of use cases.

17. Meaning of LOC in Software Estimation:
   Answer: Lines of Code.
   Explanation: LOC is used to quantify the size of a software project.

18. Primary Unit of Work in Agile Development Estimation:
   Answer: User Stories.
   Explanation: User stories provide a functional perspective for effort estimation in Agile development.

19. Basis of Empirical Estimation Models for Software Cost and Effort:
   Answer: Historical project data.
   Explanation: These models use past data to predict future efforts and costs.

20. Limitation of Delaying Estimation in Projects:
   Answer: It may lead to serious errors in estimates as time progresses.
   Explanation: Delaying estimation reduces the time available for accurate assessment, increasing error likelihood.
