Statement of Scope for University Course Grade Analysis Application

Project Title: University Course Grade Analysis Application

Background: This application is designed to assist university administrators and educators in analyzing the performance of students in various courses. By providing an average grade for each course in a specific term, stakeholders can identify trends, areas for improvement, and the overall effectiveness of the course material and instruction.

Objective: The primary objective is to develop an application that calculates and reports the average grade obtained by students in each course for a given academic term.

Scope Inclusions:
1. Data Collection: The application will interface with the university's existing database to retrieve relevant data, including course names, student enrolment details, and grades.
2. Grade Analysis: It will calculate the average grade for each course offered in a specified term.
3. Reporting: The application will generate reports that list courses alongside their average grades for the term in question.
4. User Interface: A user-friendly interface will allow users to select a specific academic term and view the corresponding average grades for courses.
5. Data Security: Implement standard security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of student data.

Scope Exclusions:
1. Individual Student Performance: The application will not analyze or report individual student performance or grades.
2. Historical Data Comparison: It will not compare current data with historical data across different terms or academic years.
3. Predictive Analysis: The application is not designed for predictive analytics or forecasting future grade trends.
4. Non-Grade Data Analysis: Analysis of non-grade data such as attendance, participation, or demographic information is not included.
5. Cross-Course Comparison: It will not provide functionality to compare average grades between courses.

Assumptions:
- The university's database is up-to-date and accurately reflects the grades and courses for the specified term.
- Users of the application will have authorized access to the grade data.

Constraints:
- The application will be developed within a predefined timeline and budget.
- It will be compatible with the university's existing database and IT infrastructure.

Success Criteria:
- Accurate calculation of average grades for each course.
- User-friendly interface for selecting terms and viewing reports.
- Positive feedback from a test group of university administrators and educators.
